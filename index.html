        Below are some of the projects I've done. Here I've mostly only included projects that are
        deployed on the web because they're the easiest for you to try out.

      <h1>Sakubun</h1>
      <p>
        Sakubun is a web app that helps people practice Japanese. Japanese uses three different
        scripts, called hiragana, katakana, and kanji. Hiragana and katakana are phonetic
        scripts, while kanji is a logographic system based on Chinese characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several thousand kanji that are used commonly, so learning them takes a lot of time.
        Sakubun helps Japanese learners practice kanji by giving them tailored quizzes that are
        generated based on what kanji they already know.

      <h2>H2K</h2>
      <p>
        H2K is a browser extension for improving your Japanese reading skills. It lets you
        automatically convert text on a webpage between hiragana and katakana (scripts used
        in Japanese), so that you get more practice in the script you're less familiar with.
